## Introduction

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau describes the mortgage market as “the single largest market for consumer financial products and services in the United States.”<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>  It is estimated that 37% of all households had at least one mortgage on their property as of 2015, as compared with 26% of households that own their home outright, and 37% that rent.<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>  Due to the prevalence of mortgages and the high cost of purchasing a home relative to other consumer spending, mortgages are also responsible for an outsized portion of Americans’ total household debt. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that mortgage debt accounts for about $9.8T of $14.3T in total household debt (69%), significantly eclipsing the next largest categories of student loan debt ($1.54T) and auto loan debt ($1.34T).<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>

In addition to their outsized role in household debt, mortgages also play a crucial role in allowing consumers to build wealth. As of 2016, housing made up roughly 60% of the median family’s assets.<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>  Additionally, economists argue that investing in homeownership generates strong financial returns relative to other investment options, and that the wealth-building potential of homeownership makes it a key lever for enabling families to achieve the American Dream.<sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup>
